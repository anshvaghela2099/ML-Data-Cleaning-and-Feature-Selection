# ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection

## Overview

This notebook focuses on performing essential steps for **data cleaning** and **feature selection** in a machine learning workflow. It uses a dataset related to customer churn in the banking industry, demonstrating how to clean data, preprocess features, and select the most important attributes for building predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook contains the following features:

1. `CustomerID`
2. `Credit Score`
3. `Country`
4. `Gender`
5. `Age`
6. `Tenure`
7. `Balance`
8. `Product Number`
9. `Credit Card`
10. `Active Member`
11. `Estimated Salary`
12. `Churn` (Target variable)

## Key Features of the Notebook

- **Data Import**: Loading the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and ensuring data integrity.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming categorical and numerical variables using encoding and scaling techniques.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features using statistical methods and domain knowledge.

## Requirements

This notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## Learning Outcomes

- Gain practical knowledge of data preprocessing techniques.
- Understand how to prepare raw datasets for machine learning models.
- Learn methods to identify and select features critical for predictive accuracy.
